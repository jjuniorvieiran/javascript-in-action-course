The course design will build a stock exchange trading register. We will register new negotiations, they will be imported from specialized services, all applying the functional and object-oriented paradigm at the same time, using the best of both worlds.

At first, the scope of our application may seem very small, but it is enough to apply new features of the JavaScript language, or ECMAScript 2015 (ES6), technically speaking. In addition, we will organize our code in the Model-View-Controller (MVC) model, apply design patterns, program asynchronously with promises, render templates, and work with proxies, among other things.
